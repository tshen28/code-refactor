# code-refactor

## Description

For our first homework assignement, we were given an existing code and prompted to refactor it. Refactoring existing code (improving it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new technology is a common task for front-end and junior developers. For this particular homework assignment, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. With a given list of specific criteria, the goal is to make the existing code more accessible through checking that all the links are functioning correctly, following semantic structure of the HTML elements, commenting any changes made, etc.
